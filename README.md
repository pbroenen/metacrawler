Self-contained in one AWS CloudFormation "stack" script, this utility reads canonical Denodo views to access the proprietary metadata tables of Informatica PowerCenter, Oracle, and SQL Server to produce technical debt metrics and simple query tables (in AWS State Machine, S3, JSON format, Python 3 Lambdas, with Athena and Glue catalogs).
